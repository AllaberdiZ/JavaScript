    <h2>JS Strings</h2>
    <p>
      You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes
      surrounding the string:
    </p>
    <p id="demo"></p>
    <script>
      var x = "It's alright.";
      var y = " He is called 'Johnny'";
      var z = 'He is called "Johnny"';
      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x + "<br>" + y + "<br>" + z;
    </script>
  </body>
